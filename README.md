# SCSS Tutorial

This is the code from freecodecamp's Sass tutorial, but using webpack instead of VSCode extensions.

You can start it in dev mode by running:

```bash
yarn dev
# OR
npm run dev
```

You can build it for prod by running:

```bash
yarn build
# OR
npm run build
```

You can serve it in prod by running:

```bash
serve dist
```

Make sure that you have `serve` installed.
